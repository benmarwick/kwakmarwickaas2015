### Compendium DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1444025

### Authors of this repository:
Seungki Kwak and Ben Marwick (skkwak@uw.edu, bmarwick@uw.edu)

### How to use:

First, ensure that you have installed R, RStudio, and the `ggplot2` package. We also recommend installing the dependencies listed below to recreate our computational environment. 

Second, download and unzip our compendium from [http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1444025](http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1444025) or clone it from github.

Third, once you have a local copy of the compendium, open and run the `kwak_marwick_jas.Rproj` file in RStudio. This will set the working directory to the location of the files.

Fourth, run `devtools::install("kwakmarwickjas2015")` to install the functions used by this compendium. 

Fifth, look in the `analysis/` directory and open the `analysis.Rmd` file in RStudio. Then run `rmarkdown::render()` or click the 'knit' button in RStudio. This will generate a HTML document that includes the plots from the manuscript. 
### Contents

The `analysis/` folder contains an R markdown file that, when executed, will generate the figures found in the manuscript.

Also within the `analysis/` folder is the `data/` folder which contains CSV files. 

"sampling_Kimpo.CSV" and "sampling_Sosa.CSV" are the data files of the entire collected samples in this paper. 

"CSIA_KM.CSV" and "CSIA_SS.CSV" are the data files of GC-MS and compound specific isotope analysis. CSIA_KM.CSV contains data from the Kimpo-Yangchon site. CSIA_SS.CSV contains data from the Sosa-Dong site.

"GC-MS_exported_data_Figure5a/b.CSV" is the data file that includes retention time and peak area data of the GC-MS chromatogram in the paper (Figure 5).

The `R/` folder contains an a R script file with our two custom plotting functions. These functions are for general use with GC-MS and CSIA data relating to archaeological foodways. The other items in our compendium are typical components of a simple R package.
